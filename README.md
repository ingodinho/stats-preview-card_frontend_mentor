### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Its easier to get 2 elements to have the same width with css grid than with flexbox. At least with my actual knowledge with these two.

### Continued development

I really should dive deeper into images und responsivenes. Still don't know if it's smarter to use background-images or html-images.
